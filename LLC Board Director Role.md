# LLC Board Director Role 

## Overview of the IETF Administration LLC
The IETF Administration LLC ("IETF LLC") provides a corporate legal framework for facilitating current and future activities related to the Internet Engineering Task Force as well as its sister organizations, the Internet Architecture Board and the Internet Research Task Force. IETF LLC exists to provide administrative support to these organizations. Its responsibilities are:

* Operations.  IETF LLC is responsible for supporting the ongoing operations of the IETF, including meetings and non-meeting activities.

* Finances.  IETF LLC is responsible for managing the IETF's finances and budget.

* Fundraising.  IETF LLC is responsible for raising money on behalf of the IETF.

* Compliance.  IETF LLC is responsible for establishing and enforcing policies to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

## Relation to the Internet Society
IETF LLC is organized as a “disregarded entity” of the Internet Society ("ISOC"), which means it operates as a branch or division of ISOC for tax purposes. ISOC is a US 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization founded in 1992 that supports and promotes the development of the Internet as a global technical infrastructure, a resource to enrich people’s lives, and a force for good in society.

# Establishment of the IETF LLC
IETF LLC will be established in late 2018. It will initially be managed by an interim board of directors until the first full board of directors is seated in late 2018 or early 2019, which depends upon NomCom appointments.

## IETF LLC Board Overview
Candidates are sought for the role of board director on the first full board. All board directors are unpaid volunteers.

The IETF LLC Board of Directors is responsible for setting broad strategic direction for IETF LLC. The board will be responsible for hiring and supervising an Executive Director. The Executive Director will be responsible for managing the day-to-day affairs of IETF LLC, including hiring staff to carry out the LLC’s responsibilities.

The board’s other responsibilities include adopting an annual budget, adopting employee benefit plans, consulting the IETF community on matters as appropriate, and approving entering into agreements that that meet a significant materiality threshold. Ideally, some board directors will be positioned to play an active role in helping to secure financial resources for the IETF and to leverage personal connections that help the staff identify and solicit potential funders. The board’s work is high-level and strategic; the board is expected to delegate management of day-to-day activities and related decision-making to staff.

## Candidate Experience
Ideal candidates for the role of board director should have prior professional experience with:

* Executive management, compensation, and performance review;
* Financial management and budgeting on a seven-figure scale;
* Working with legal counsel to address organization-related legal and compliance issues;
* Fundraising in the non-profit sector; and
* Working with geographically diverse colleagues and populations.

Preference may be given to candidates with prior non-profit or corporate board experience and/or prior experience with the IETF or other similar technical or standards development organizations.

## Candidate Requirements
Requirements for the role of board director include:

* Taking on legal and fiduciary responsibility for IETF LLC.
* Traveling to board meetings multiple times per year. The number of meetings per year, their locations, decisions about co-locating them with IETF meetings, and availability of travel funding will be decided at the board’s discretion with input from the IETF community.
* Attending regular conference calls, potentially in different time zones outside of normal business hours.
* Preparing for board meetings and calls in advance and actively participating in board discussions.
* Making heavy use of email and other online communications tools as key means for advancing the work of the board and conversing with staff and IETF participants.
* Operating transparently and engaging openly with the IETF community and the staff.
* Acting in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and board policies. 

In the board’s first year it is anticipated that board directors will spend an average of four hours per week on the board’s work.
