--- abstract

The IETF is transitioning to a new version 2.0 of the IETF Administrative Support Activity. As part of this transition, the Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) will be eliminated, and its oversight and advising functions transferred to the new IETF Administration LLC ("LLC"). The LLC will have a Board of Directors and the IETF Nominations Committee ("NomCom") will need to appoint several members. This document provides short-term guidance to the NomCom for the 2018-2019 nominations cycle to help the NomCom with their initial selections.

# Introduction

The IETF is transitioning to a new version 2.0 of the IETF Administrative Support Activity. As part of this transition, the Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) will be eliminated, and its oversight and advising functions transferred to the new IETF Administration LLC ("LLC"). The LLC will have a Board of Directors and the IETF Nominations Committee ("NomCom") will need to appoint several members. This document provides short-term guidance to the NomCom for the 2018-2019 nominations cycle to help the NomCom with their initial selections.

{{?I-D.iasa2-structure}} provides a high-level summary of the structure and responsibilities. This document is intended to be much more tactical in nature, provding the 2018-2019 NomCom with the direction and guidance necessary to constitute the first full Board of the LLC. 

## Scope Limitation

The document is only intended to provide near-term guidance to the NomCom. Eventually a full update of RFC 4371 is planned.

# Specific Directions to the NomCom {#directions}

## Discontinue IAOC Appointments {#stop-iaoc-appointments}

The 2018-2019 NomCom does not need to fill any further roles on the IAOC. Instead, the NomCom will need to fill roles for the LLC during this NomCom cycle.

## Make Three Initial IETF LLC Nominations {#start-llc-appointments}

A minimum of five Directors must be seated in order for the Board to be constituted, and the Interim Board to be dissolved, as noted in {{?I-D.iasa2-structure}}. One director will be appointed by the Internet Society (ISOC), one by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), and three by the NomCom. The three appointments from the NomCom MUST be confirmed by the IESG.

## Confirm Nominations by March 22, 2019 {#appointments-deadline}

The first full board MUST be formed no later than the end of the first quarter of 2019. ISOC and the IESG have been asked to make their appointments no later than January 31, 2019. Given that the NomCom needs to select more than those other bodies, additional time has been alloted, and the 2018-2019 NomCom MUST make their appointments no later than March 22, 2019. If the NomCom can make their appointments sooner, then by all means they should do so in order to enable the first full board to begin as soon as possible, potentially in time for IETF 104 (March 23-29, 2019).

## Term Lengths {#term-lengths}

In order to create staggered terms so that in future years the NomCom will not generally need to make three appointments, the following term lengths SHOULD be used:

* One for a 1-year term
* One for a 2-year term
* One for a 3-year term

# LLC Director Recruitment Skills and Experience {#skills-experience}

The NomCom will need to know the types of skills and experience needed to best serve the LLC and therefore make their appointments. All members of the NomCom SHOULD read {{?I-D.iasa2-structure}}. As a general matter, the LLC needs Directors that can think and act strategically, and not focus on tactical matters. The NomCom should also keep in mind that the type of work the LLC will do is very different than that of the IAOC. 

The folllowing SHOULD also guide the NomCom in their appointments:

1 - Candidates SHOULD have prior board experience

2 - Candidates MUST have experience with legal matters, such as contract negotiation. 

3 - Candidated MUST havbe financial experience, such as developing, managing, or reviewing multi-million-dollar annual budgets.

4 - Candidates MUST have experience recruitnent and hiring/firing, conducting employee performance reviews, and managing other human resources matters.

5 - Candidates SHOULD be willing and interested in developing key policy documents and have appropriate experience. The LLC will need to develop policies such as: 
* Conflict of Interest;
* Acceptance of gifts and other non-cash compensation;
* Travel and expense reimbursement;
* Anti-bribery;
* Code of conduct;
* Anti-harassment;
* Non-discrimination;
* Whistleblower;
* Document retention;
* Export controls;
* Anti-terrorism sanctions;
* Data protection and privacy;
* Social media

6 - Candidates SHOULD have experience in business operations, so that they have an understanding of what is necessary to successfully conduct large meetings around the world, collect fees, pay vendors, configure employee benefit and compensation plans, and so on.

7 - Candidates SHOULD have experience and/or a deep understanding of non-profit fundraising, given that the LLC is responsible for raising money on behalf of the IETF.

8 - Candidates SHOULD have at least a general understanding of what the IETF does and how it compares to other standards development organizations.

9 - Candidates MUST be experienced in the use of online collaboration and meeting tools, such as video conferencing.

10 - Candidates MUST be able to travel internationally for LLC Board meetings as needed.

11 - Candidates MUST be able to make themselves available to attend all regular meetings of the LLC Board, and be responsive to any LLC Board email discussions. We anticipate in the first year of the full board, an average of four hours per week of work may be necessary.

## Engaged Directors Needed {#engagement}

Given the small size of the LLC Board and the great many activities that are necessary to start the LLC and create initial policies and processes, candidates need to understand that they MUST be fully engaged as Directors. Thus, simply attending Board meetings will not suffice.

## IETF Experience {#ietf-experience}

Candidates do NOT need to have significant technical experience as an IETF contributor, though some candidates with such experience may be helpful. But since candidates with outside expertise that may not have attended an IETF meeting may not be known to the NomCom, the NomCom MUST solicit feedback and take reasonable steps to ensure that outside candidates are duly considered.
