[Editor's note: I'm not sure that the IAOC is the correct group to provide this request to the NomCom or that any group can. That is TBD. At a minimum the NomCom chair should keep in mind that no IAOC slots must be filled.]


We recommend that the IAOC send the following direction to the 2018 NomCom via email:

## Discontinue IAOC Appointments
The 2018 NomCom does not need to fill any further roles on the IAOC. 

Instead, the NomCom will need to fill roles for the IETF Administration LLC during this NomCom cycle.
