[Editor's note: I'm not sure that the IAOC is the correct group to provide this request to the NomCom or that any group can. That is TBD. At a minimum the NomCom chair should keep in mind that no IAOC slots must be filled.]

[DOC NOT NEEDED. Per John Levine on the WG mailing list: Under RFC 7437 the Nomcom does not have discretion about whether to fill a vacancy.  IAOC will notify Nomcom if there's a vacancy. We all realize that the IAOC is likely to disappear by the end of the year, so there's no point to putting a lot of effort into this either way.]

We recommend that the IAOC send the following direction to the 2018 NomCom via email:

## Discontinue IAOC Appointments
The 2018 NomCom does not need to fill any further roles on the IAOC. 

Instead, the NomCom will need to fill roles for the IETF Administration LLC during this NomCom cycle.
